We shall press forward in the face of adversity, we shall stand strong across the vast landscapes of Canada,
We shall rise in the forests and in the mountains,
We shall thrive along the great rivers and the boundless prairies,
With unyielding courage, we shall defend the true North, whatever the challenge may be,
From the rugged shores of Newfoundland to the icy expanse of the Arctic,
We shall unite as one people, embracing our diversity,
We shall work together in our cities, in our towns, and in the heart of the wilderness;
For in the spirit of Canada, there is no surrender, no retreat, only the steadfast belief
That we shall always persevere, and no matter the storm, we shall carry the torch of peace, freedom, and hope.
